summary: Computing the maximum from a list of secret inputs is a widely-used functionality that is employed either indirectly as a building block in secure computation frameworks, such as ABY (NDSS'15)  or directly used in multiple applications that solve optimisation problems, such as secure machine learning or secure aggregation statistics. {\em Incremental distributed point function} (I-DPF) is a powerful primitive (IEEE S\&P'21) that significantly reduces the client-to-server communication and are employed to efficiently and securely compute aggregation statistics. Our protocols have a communication complexity that is independent of the number of secret inputs and linear to the length of the secret input domain. Our experimental results show enhanced efficiency over state-of-the-art solutions, particularly notable when handling large-scale inputs. For instance, in scenarios involving an input set of five million elements with an input domain size of 31 bits, our protocol \(\Pi_{\mathsf{Max}}\) achieves an $18\%$ reduction in online execution time and a  $67\%$ decrease in communication volume compared to the most efficient existing solution.

### Abstract

In this paper, we investigate whether I-DPF can be used to improve the efficiency of secure two-party computation (2PC) with an emphasis on computing the maximum value and the k-th (with k unknown to the computing parties) ranked value from a list of secret inputs. Our answer is affirmative, and we propose novel secure 2PC protocols that use I-DPF as a building block, resulting in significant efficiency gains compared to the state-of-the-art. More precisely, our contributions are (i) We present two new secure computation frameworks that efficiently compute secure aggregation statistics bit-wisely or batch-wisely; (ii) we propose novel protocols to compute the maximum value, the k-th ranked value from a list of secret inputs; (iii) we provide variations of the proposed protocols that can perform batch computations and thus provide further efficiency improvements; and (iv) we provide an extensive performance evaluation for all proposed protocols.
